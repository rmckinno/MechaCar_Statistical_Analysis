# MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis
Using R-Script to perform statistical analysis a given datasets.

## Tools
R-Studio
R

## Overview
In this analysis, R is used to:
- Perform multiple linear regression analysis to identify which variables in the MechaCar dataset best predict the mpg of MechaCar prototypes
- Collect summary statistics on the pounds per square inch (PSI) of the suspension coils from the manufacturing lots
- Run t-tests to determine if the manufacturing lots are statistically different from the mean population
- Design a statistical study to compare vehicle performance of the MechaCar vehicles against vehicles from other manufacturers. For each statistical analysis, you'll write a summary interpretation of the findings.
